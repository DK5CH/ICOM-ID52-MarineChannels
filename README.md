### Importing procedure

- Start the ICOM CS-52 software on your computer
- load the current radio configuration into the software
- **backup your current configuration on your computer**
- in the CS-52 software menu tree find memory CH and expand it
- click add group and name the group to your liking "e.g. Marine"
- a new empty memory table appears on the right
- right click on the newly created group and select **Import -> Group** (not import all !!!)
- select the **MarineChannels.csv** in the location you downloaded it and click open
- a warning is displayed, that all content in the current sheet will be overwritten, as we created a blank group, you can confirm this
- now you see the sheet on the right populated with the marine channels
- check the channels, if they meet your expectations
- if you are happy with the channels write the configuration back to the radio
- restart your radio

### Using the channels on your radio

- Press MR to get into memory read mode
- press Quick -> Group Select and select the memory group "e.g. Marine"
- use the channel dial to browse the channels or long press SCAN to continuously scan these channels

### Why do we have duplex configured channels, if we only receive?

- by pressing the monitor button (under the ptt) you switch to the offset frequency, therefor duplex is configured

I hope you enjoy listening to marine channels, if you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know.
